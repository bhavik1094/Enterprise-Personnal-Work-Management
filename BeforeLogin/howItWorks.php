            <h1>How does GetLance Works?</h1>
            <p>
                At GetLance, you won’t have to figure out how to find the best talent, throw project requirements over a wall, deal with multiple middlemen managing your team, or pay a flat project fee. 
                Instead, you will connect with a superb freelancer who will interface with your team as an internal team member working from home would.
